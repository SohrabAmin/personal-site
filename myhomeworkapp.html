    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      MyHomeworkApp is a web app concept in which the UI and UX was designed in
      Figma, Adobe XD and Photoshop. This app aims to help students keep track
      of their homework and grades for each course and better their studying
      habits. I haven't able to find any homework trackers that also keep track
      of grades and I wanted to get some practice with figma.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really wanted to focus on human centered design that was intuitive
      enough to use without any in-app tutorials (lol). Inspired from some of
      the amazing user experiences over at Notion and my struggles as a student,
      I was set on building something that actually helped students achieve
      their academic goals.
