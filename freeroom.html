    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Free Room is a Python application provides students free lecture and
      tutorial rooms that are currently not in use at the University of Toronto
      Mississauga.

    <h2 class="screenshot-header">Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The project started when I was trying to find a place to study at UTM and
      couldn't find a single free area near me. <br />
      <br />After some digging I found out that UofT has an open source API that
      allows users to access lecture times and rooms. Instantly, I figured that
      if I can find out which courses are using what room at what time, I can
      theoretically find a <em>free room</em>. <br />
      <br />
      I've completed and used this project and was debating whether or not to
      make this data public and perhaps even create a web app. My school work
      got ahead of me, so my friends and I were really the only ones using this
      information. <br />
      <br />
      This was a fun and useful project that involved some interesting problem
      solving, like figuring out what best data structures to use and find the
      combined free time a room had. To my surprise there were some popular,
      larger rooms that were booked for the whole day, every week! <br />
